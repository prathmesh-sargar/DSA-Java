# ðŸ“š DSA Topic: **Hashing / HashMap / HashSet**

Hashing is the backbone of **efficient lookups, frequency counting, and duplicate detection**. HashMaps and HashSets are essential for solving problems in O(1) time on average.

## ðŸ§© Hashing Patterns

---

### 1. âœ… **Frequency Counting**

Used to count how many times a value or character appears.

ðŸ§  **When to Use:**
â†’ Whenever you need to **track counts, frequency, or duplicate entries**.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
* [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
* [Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)
* [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)
* [First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)

---

### 2. âœ… **Duplicate Detection / Fast Lookup**

HashSet is perfect for **checking if something exists or is a duplicate** in O(1) time.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
* [Contains Duplicate II](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/)
* [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)
* [Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)
* [Intersection of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/)

---

### 3. âœ… **Prefix / Suffix Hashing**

Used in advanced substring problems and rolling hash logic.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)
* [Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/)
* [Continuous Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/)
* [Binary Subarrays With Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/)

---

### 4. âœ… **HashMap + Sliding Window**

Often used when dealing with substrings, frequency maps, and windows.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)
* [Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)
* [Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)
* [Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/)

---

### 5. âœ… **Hashing for 2D or Nested Data**

Handle hash-based lookups in matrices, graphs, or nested arrays.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)
* [Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)
* [Encode and Decode TinyURL](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/)
* [Fraction to Recurring Decimal](https://leetcode.com/problems/fraction-to-recurring-decimal/)

---

### 6. âœ… **Custom HashMap / HashSet Design**

Some advanced questions test your understanding of how hashing works internally.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Design HashMap](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashmap/)
* [Design HashSet](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/)
* [LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)
* [Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/)

---

### ðŸ§  Tips to Master Hashing:

* Always think of **HashMap** for key-value mapping or frequency.
* Use **HashSet** when you only care about **existence** or **uniqueness**.
* In Java, prefer `Map<Integer, Integer>` or `Set<Integer>`.
* **Check constraints**: use `long` for sum-based keys to avoid overflow.
* Hashing is a **helper pattern** â€” itâ€™s often used with arrays, strings, sliding window, or graphs.

### âœ… Final Thoughts

If you master:

* HashMap for counting and mapping
* HashSet for uniqueness
* Prefix sum logic using hashing
* Hash + sliding window for substring problems

You will unlock **hundreds of real-world DSA questions** and interview problems.
