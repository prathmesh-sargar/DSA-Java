# ðŸ“š DSA Topic: **Bit Manipulation**

Bit Manipulation uses operations like **AND, OR, XOR, NOT, SHIFT** directly on binary representations of numbers.
This allows for:

* Ultra-fast computation
* Space-efficient solutions
* Elegant tricks in number theory

## ðŸ§© Common Bitwise Operators

| Operation   | Symbol | Example (a=5, b=3)   | Result    |       |           |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------- | --------- | ----- | --------- |
| AND         | `&`    | `5 & 3 â†’ 101 & 011`  | `001 â†’ 1` |       |           |
| OR          | `\|`   | \`5                  | 3 â†’ 101   | 011\` | `111 â†’ 7` |
| XOR         | `^`    | `5 ^ 3 â†’ 101 ^ 011`  | `110 â†’ 6` |       |           |
| NOT         | `~`    | `~5 â†’ -6` (2's comp) |           |       |           |
| Left Shift  | `<<`   | `5 << 1 â†’ 1010`      | `10`      |       |           |
| Right Shift | `>>`   | `5 >> 1 â†’ 010`       | `2`       |       |           |
