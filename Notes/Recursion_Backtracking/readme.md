# 📚 DSA Topic: **Recursion & Backtracking**

These topics help you break big problems into smaller ones, explore possibilities, and are the base for **divide & conquer**, **DFS**, and **pattern generation problems**.

> ⚠️ Most students struggle here — but you won’t, because we’ll break it down pattern-by-pattern.

## 🧩 Recursion & Backtracking Patterns

---

### 1. ✅ **Basic Recursion (Breaking Down Problems)**

Learn how to divide a problem into subproblems — **Base Case + Recursive Case**.

🧠 **When to Use:**
→ When a problem can be solved by solving **smaller versions of itself**.

📌 **Questions**:

* [Factorial using Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-factorial-of-a-number/)
* [Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)
* [Power of x (xⁿ)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)
* [Sum of Digits / Natural Numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-digits-using-recursion/)

---

### 2. ✅ **Backtracking Basics (Try-All-Options)**

Backtracking = Try one option → move forward → if wrong, **undo and try next**.

🧠 **When to Use:**
→ When solving problems with **combinations, permutations, and constraints**.

📌 **Questions**:

* [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)
* [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)
* [Combinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/)
* [Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)
* [Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/)

---

### 3. ✅ **Backtracking with Constraints**

Now apply **"Yes/No" rules** or **paths that must meet conditions**.

📌 **Questions**:

* [Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)
* [Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/)
* [N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)
* [Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)
* [Restore IP Addresses](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/)

---

### 4. ✅ **Generating All Combinations / Strings**

Focus on generating **all possible valid outputs** — often used in interviews.

📌 **Questions**:

* [Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/)
* [Binary Watch](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch/)
* [Expression Add Operators](https://leetcode.com/problems/expression-add-operators/)
* [Gray Code](https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/)

---

### 5. ✅ **DFS using Recursion**

Explore all paths in a tree, matrix, or graph recursively.

📌 **Questions**:

* [Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/)
* [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
* [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)
* [Word Ladder II (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/)

---

### 6. ✅ **Recursion + Memoization (Top-down DP)**

To **optimize recursive calls**, use memoization (storing previously solved subproblems).

📌 **Questions**:

* [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
* [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)
* [Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)
* [Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)
* [Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/)

---

### 🧠 Tips to Master Recursion & Backtracking:

* Write the **base case** first.
* Always **draw the recursion tree** when confused.
* Backtracking needs **"undo"** step → remove added item before next recursion.
* Use `visited[]` or backtrack with `in-place swapping`.
* Optimize repeated subproblems using **memoization** (HashMap or DP array).

---

### ✅ Final Thoughts

Once you’re solid with:

* Recursion structure
* Subsets, permutations
* DFS and path exploration
* Backtracking with constraints

You’ll be able to solve **a wide class of real-world problems** — from pathfinding to game solvers to AI-based logic engines.
