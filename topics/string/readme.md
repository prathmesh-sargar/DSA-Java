# ðŸ“š DSA Topic: **Strings**

Just like arrays, **strings** are fundamental in coding interviews. Many string problems require mastering **patterns** like sliding window, hashing, two pointers, and frequency maps.

This README-style breakdown includes:

* âœ… Pattern names
* ðŸ§  Description of patterns
* ðŸ“Œ 15â€“20 most important Leetcode problems with links

## ðŸ§© String Patterns

---

### 1. âœ… **Two Pointers**

Used to compare characters from both ends or across indexes.

ðŸ§  **When to Use:**
â†’ Checking for palindromes, removing duplicates, reversing strings.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)
* [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)
* [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
* [Palindrome Linked List (variation)](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)
* [Valid Palindrome II (at most one delete)](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/)

---

### 2. âœ… **Sliding Window**

Efficiently checks or tracks properties in substrings.

ðŸ§  **When to Use:**
â†’ Longest/shortest substring with conditions, character frequency match.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
* [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)
* [Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)
* [Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)
* [Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

---

### 3. âœ… **Hashing / Frequency Map**

Track character count, duplicates, and anagrams using `HashMap` or arrays.

ðŸ§  **When to Use:**
â†’ Anagrams, character comparisons, isomorphic checks.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
* [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)
* [Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)
* [First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)
* [Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

---

### 4. âœ… **String Reversal / Manipulation**

Basic but important problems for string operations.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)
* [Reverse Words in a String III](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/)
* [Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)
* [Add Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/)
* [Multiply Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/)

---

### 5. âœ… **Pattern Matching / Encoding**

Often used in compression or decoding logic.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Encode and Decode Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/)
* [Zigzag Conversion](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/)
* [Integer to Roman](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/)
* [Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)
* [Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)

---

### 6. âœ… **Trie (Prefix Tree â€“ Advanced)**

When problems involve **prefix/suffix searching**, auto-complete.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)
* [Longest Word in Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary/)
* [Replace Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words/)

---

### ðŸ§  Tips to Master Strings:

* Always think in terms of **sliding window** and **frequency map** for repeated character-based questions.
* **Dry run small examples** especially when dealing with edge conditions.
* Be comfortable with **ASCII indexing** (`char - 'a'`) and basic string manipulations in Java.

---

### âœ… Final Thoughts

Once you're confident with:

* 2 pointers
* sliding window
* hashing
* character frequencies
* and manipulation,

Youâ€™ll be ready for **any string question in placements** and **real-world input processing**.
