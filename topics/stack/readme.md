# ðŸ“š DSA Topic: **Stack**

Stacks are a **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** data structure. This topic appears frequently in coding rounds for problems involving **reversals, parenthesis matching, monotonic sequences**, and **next greater/smaller element** problems.

## ðŸ§© Stack Patterns

---

### 1. âœ… **Basic Stack Operations**

Push, pop, top, and check if the stack is empty â€” these are the fundamentals. You often use either a stack directly or simulate one using arrays or strings.

ðŸ§  **When to Use:**
â†’ Reverse something, undo operations, evaluate expressions.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
* [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)
* [Implement Stack using Queues](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/)
* [Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)

---

### 2. âœ… **Next Greater / Smaller Element (Monotonic Stack)**

These use **increasing or decreasing stacks** to find nearest greater/smaller element in O(n).

ðŸ§  **When to Use:**
â†’ When you need to find a next larger/smaller number, index, or pattern to the right or left.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)
* [Next Greater Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)
* [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-tematures/)
* [Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)
* [Maximal Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/) *(2D variant)*

### 3. âœ… **Stack for String Processing**

Used to process and simplify strings using stack logic.

ðŸ§  **When to Use:**
â†’ When you want to remove characters, decode strings, or simulate stack behavior on characters.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/)
* [Backspace String Compare](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/)
* [Basic Calculator](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/)
* [Basic Calculator II](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/)
* [Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)

### 4. âœ… **Infix to Postfix / Expression Evaluation**

These are classic **interview questions** from stacks â€” especially if you're asked to build a compiler or calculator.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)
* [Basic Calculator II](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/)
* [Basic Calculator III (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-iii/) *(follow-up)*

### 5. âœ… **Stock Span / Range Problems**

Use stacks to calculate number of days/values before or after satisfying a certain condition.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Online Stock Span](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/)
* [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-tematures/)
* [Next Greater Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)
* [Sum of Subarray Minimums](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/)

---

### 6. âœ… **Design Problems Using Stack**

Often combined with other data structures like queues or priority queues.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)
* [Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)
* [Implement Stack using Queues](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/)
* [Design Browser History (variation)](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-browser-history/)

---

### ðŸ§  Tips to Master Stack:

* Learn to simulate stack using arrays or lists.
* Focus on **Monotonic Stack** â€” it's used in hard problems too!
* Use **dry runs and trace** how elements are added/removed from the stack.
* When dealing with index-based problems, **store index** instead of the value in the stack.
* Understand stack **patterns by drawing diagrams** step-by-step.

---

### âœ… Final Thoughts

Once you're confident with:

* Monotonic stacks
* Valid parentheses logic
* String and number stack evaluations

You'll be able to tackle **a large chunk of interview questions** related to strings, arrays, and even graphs.
