### 🧩 Array Patterns

---

#### 1. ✅ **Two Pointers**

Used when working on sorted arrays or strings to **reduce time complexity**. Involves using two indices moving toward each other or in the same direction.

**When to use?**
→ Problems involving **pair checking, sorting, merging, duplicates**.

📌 **Questions**:

* [Two Sum II - Input array is sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
* [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)
* [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)
* [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
* [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

---

#### 2. ✅ **Sliding Window**

Efficient for **contiguous subarray** problems involving sums, averages, max/min values, etc.

**When to use?**
→ When dealing with **window/k-sized subarrays**.

📌 **Questions**:

* [Maximum Average Subarray I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/)
* [Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

---

#### 6. ✅ **Hashing with Arrays**

Useful when solving **frequency-based** problems or quick lookups.

📌 **Questions**:

* [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
* [Intersection of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/)
* [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
* [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

---

#### 7. ✅ **Binary Search in Arrays**

Used for **searching efficiently** in sorted arrays.

📌 **Questions**:

### 🧠 Key Tips for Mastery

* 🔁 **Revise frequently**: Come back to key problems after 7–10 days.
* 📝 **Dry run tricky problems**: Don’t skip the ones you fail.
* 🚀 **Focus on approach first**, then code.
* 📌 **Tag your GitHub code** with pattern name inside folders for easy tracking.
