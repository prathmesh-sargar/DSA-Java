# ðŸ“š DSA Topic: **Linked List**

Linked Lists are one of the **most common DSA topics** in coding rounds and interviews. They are great for testing your understanding of **pointers, memory manipulation**, and **in-place updates**.

---

## ðŸ§© Linked List Patterns

---

### 1. âœ… **Basic Operations (Insertion, Deletion, Traversal)**

These are the building blocks of linked list problems.

ðŸ§  **When to Use:**
â†’ Learn pointer movement, node creation, and head/tail updates.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
* [Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)
* [Remove Linked List Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/)
* [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
* [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

---

### 2. âœ… **Two Pointers (Fast & Slow)**

Used to detect cycles, find mid-points, and remove nodes from end efficiently.

ðŸ§  **When to Use:**
â†’ When you need to find mid, detect loops, or do actions at variable speed.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
* [Linked List Cycle II (Start of loop)](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)
* [Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)
* [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
* [Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

---

### 3. âœ… **Reversing Variations**

Understanding reversal is important for solving complex transformations.

ðŸ§  **When to Use:**
â†’ Useful in segment reversal, group manipulations.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
* [Reverse Linked List II (Between positions m and n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)
* [Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)
* [Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)

---

### 4. âœ… **Cycle Detection**

Very common in interviews â€” often uses Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare algorithm.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
* [Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)
* [Happy Number (Variation)](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

---

### 5. âœ… **Merging / Sorting**

Focuses on merging two or more linked lists in sorted order.

ðŸ§  **When to Use:**
â†’ Common in system design and dynamic data systems.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
* [Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)
* [Sort List](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)
* [Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

---

### 6. âœ… **Dummy Node Pattern**

Use a dummy starter node to simplify edge case handling.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)
* [Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)
* [Odd Even Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)
* [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

---

### 7. âœ… **Pointer Manipulation Challenges**

These test **deep understanding** of pointer handling.

ðŸ“Œ **Questions**:

* [Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/)
* [Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)
* [LRU Cache (uses doubly linked list + hashmap)](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)

---

### ðŸ§  Tips to Master Linked Lists:

* Draw every pointer change while debugging â€” visualize `head`, `next`, `prev`.
* Practice dummy node trick to simplify insert/delete logic.
* Master reversing operations â€” they're used in complex problems later.
* Do **dry runs** before coding on paper or whiteboard.

---

### âœ… Final Thoughts

If you master:

* Traversal & manipulation
* Two-pointer logic
* Reversal and merging patterns

Then youâ€™ll be able to solve **almost any linked list question** â€” in **tech interviews and online tests**.
