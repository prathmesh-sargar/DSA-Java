A **graph** is a set of nodes connected by edges. It can be:

* **Directed / Undirected**
* **Weighted / Unweighted**
* **Cyclic / Acyclic**

Used in problems involving **connections, paths, dependencies, and components**.

## ðŸ§  Tips to Master Graphs

* Always clarify if the graph is **directed/undirected**, **weighted/unweighted**, and **cyclic/acyclic**.
* Use `visited[]` array to prevent revisits.
* For shortest path:

  * **Unweighted** â†’ use **BFS**
  * **Weighted** â†’ use **Dijkstra**
* Understand **difference between DFS and BFS** deeply.
* For Topological sort, know both **DFS-based** and **Kahnâ€™s Algorithm** (BFS-based).

Graph mastery means:

* You're ready to build **navigation systems, dependency resolvers, and AI paths**
* You can solve questions across **Google, Microsoft, Adobe, Flipkart, Codenation, and Infosys**
* You become confident with **recursive + iterative + greedy + backtracking** logic
